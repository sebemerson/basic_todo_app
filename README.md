# basic_todo_app 
Summary: A simple todo application written in JavaScript and JQuery.


Info: This Todo App was a project I built from
scratch with some pure JS and JQuery. I am continuing to add functionality and styles over the coming months.
This was built purely in order to practice/ refresh key concepts and test out new approaches, such as
templating with Handlebars.js and routing with Director.js.

*Please feel free to comment on the code and give me tips.
