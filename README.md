# basic_todo_app 
Summary: A simple todo application written in JavaScript and JQuery.


Info: There is a fantastic resource for learning JavaScript at practicaljavascript.net.
There you study Javascript code and programming skills in a professional way without just typing out
what you see. You are encouraged to view web applications and think through how you might
replicate them and finally build tests. This Todo App was my project which was built from
scratch with some pure JS and JQuery. I am continuing to add functionality and styles over the coming months.
This was built purely in order to practice/ refresh key concepts and test out new approaches, such as
templating with Handlebars.js and routing with Director.js.

*Please feel free to comment on the code and give me tips.
