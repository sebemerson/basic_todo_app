# todo_app 
A simple todo application written in JavaScript and JQuery.


INFO: This was a task set on a JS course found on watchandcode.com. I am rebuilding the
app from scratch for training purposes and will be going further with my own features
and styling.

*Please feel free to comment on the code and give me tips.
